### Hi there 👋
I am a software engineer interested in robotics

- 🔭 I’m currently working on a Go playing robot
- 🌱 I’m currently learning frontend development on Udacity
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on a motion planning project
- ⚡ Fun fact: Elektro, the world’s first humanoid robot, debuted in 1939. Built by Westinghouse, the seven-foot-tall walking machine “spoke” more than 700 words stored on 78-rpm records.
